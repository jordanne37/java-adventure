first time using javascript for an application for a password generator

PASSWORD GENERATOR!!!

DESCRIPTION :
A PASSWORD IS RANDOMLY GENERATED BASED ON THE USERS CRITERIA THEY SELECT.

WHEN THE USER CLICKS THE BUTTON THEY ARE FIRST ASKED HOW LONG THEY WOULD LIKE THEIR PASSWORD TO BE. BUT IT COULD ONLY BE 8-128.
IF THEY ARE NOT IN THAT RANGE THEY WILL SEE A MESSAGE THAT GIVES THEM THE RANGE AND THEY MUST SELECT AGAIN.
IT WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THEM SELECT A NUMBER UNTIL IT FALLS WITHIN THAT RANGE.

AFTER THAT IT ASK IF THEY WOULD LIKE UPPER CASE LETTERS, LOWERCASE LETTERS, NUMBERS AND/OR SPECIAL CHARACTERS.
THEY MUST CHOOSE ATLEAST ONE OR A MESSAGE OF INVALID WILL POP UP. ONCE EVERY PARAMETER IS MET THEN IT WILL GENERATE A RADNOM PASSWORD FOR THE USER.
